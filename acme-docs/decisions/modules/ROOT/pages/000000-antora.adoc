= 1. Documentation using Antora

NOTE: Accepted on 2022-01-01

== Context

A documentation tool with a familiar, lightweight markup language will make writing documentation a joy.
Ideally all documentation can be put under one site that affords a reasonable experience navigating across all the content.

== Decision

We will use https://antora.org/[Antora] to be able to aggregate all project documentation into one logical site and afford us to customize the UI.

== Consequences

=== Positive

* Antora is built on Asciidoc, which we have experience with.
* Antora supports a multitude of diagram types, including C4 models, via https://github.com/Mogztter/asciidoctor-kroki[asciidoctor-kroki]

=== Neutral

* Antora does not build navigation automatically from source files.
* Customizing the UI requires some special knowledge, however publicly available themes should suffice

=== Negative

* Changing this decision after a lot of documentation has been written would be hard to reverse.
