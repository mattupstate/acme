= 2. Use PostgreSQL for Persistence

NOTE: Accepted on 2022-01-01

== Context

The desired architectural style requires a database to persist domain objects and materialized views for presentation purposes.
Given the design of the domain objects, it is desirable to store them in the database as a document.
In contrast, it is desirable to store materialized views in a normalized fashion.

== Decision

We will use https://www.postgresql.org/[PostgreSQL] for all persistence needs as it supports both persistence strategies.
More specifically, we will use https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/datatype-json.html[JSON types] for domain object persistence.
Views will use typical relational data structures.

== Consequences

=== Positive

* Widely supported and easy to operate
* Broad ecosystem of extensions

=== Neutral

* ?

=== Negative

* This is a one-way door decision if we start to lean on PostgreSQL-only features.
