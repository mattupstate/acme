= 4. Use Angular for Web Applications

NOTE: Accepted on 2022-01-01

== Context

Using a framework will aid in the development of a web application.
Ideally, the framework is something we are familiar with already to reduce the severity of the learning curve.

== Decision

We will use https://angular.io/[Angular] for all web application development.
Additionally, we will use https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm[nvm] for managing the desired version of NodeJS.

== Consequences

=== Positive

* Widely supported and heavily invested in by Google.
* Focused ecosystem.
* Good documentation.

=== Neutral

* Code will be written in TypeScript.
* Karma will be used as the test runner.
* Jest will be the testing framework.

=== Negative

* ?
