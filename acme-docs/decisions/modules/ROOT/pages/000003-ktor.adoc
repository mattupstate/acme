= 3. Use Ktor for HTTP APIs

NOTE: Accepted on 2022-01-01

== Context

The desired architectural style includes HTTP APIs.
Choosing a web framework will aid their development.
The framework must support development using Kotlin, which we have experience with already.
Better yet, the framework would be built with Kotlin and use coroutines.

== Decision

We will use https://ktor.io/[Ktor] for all HTTP APIs.

== Consequences

=== Positive

* First class Kotlin development experience.
* Built on coroutines.
* Includes an HTTP client module.

=== Neutral

* Minimal API surface area.

=== Negative

* Still an early-stage product, likely to be a bit buggy.
* Sparse plugin ecosystem.
