= Setup

The development environment is a first-class component of this system.
From installation and configuration to supporting fast development feedback loops, it should strive to deliver the best developer experience to as many developers as possible.
This section describes the recommended steps to configure a development environment suitable for working on Acme.
Please install tools as they are mentioned in the documentation.

NOTE: Decisions made in service of this goal are often loaded with tradeoffs and are documented as a xref:acme-adr::index.adoc[Decision Record].

== Docker

WARNING: As of this writing Rancher Desktop https://github.com/rancher-sandbox/rancher-desktop/issues/1668[has an issue] with binding to privileged ports on Linux.
There is a simple workaround described in the <<Linux Users>> section.

{rancher-desktop-href}[Rancher Desktop] is recommended for running Docker locally.
Other tools, such as Docker Desktop, will have to be uninstalled or disabled before using Rancher Desktop.
Once installed, configure Rancher Desktop with:

[#img-rancher-desktop-sudo]
.Administrative Access > Allow sudo access
image::rancher-desktop-sudo.png[]

[#img-rancher-desktop-docker]
.Container Runtime > dockerd (moby)
image::rancher-desktop-docker.png[]

=== Linux Users

As of this writing Rancher Desktop https://github.com/rancher-sandbox/rancher-desktop/issues/1668[has an issue] with binding to privileged ports on Linux.
The workaround is to adjust the default `net.ipv4.ip_unprivileged_port_start` value to `80`.
Run the following command and restart Rancher Desktop afterwards:

[source,shellscript]
----
sudo sysctl net.ipv4.ip_unprivileged_port_start=80
----

This configuration makes it possible to access Kubernetes Ingress resources on `localhost` over privileged ports `80` (HTTP) and `443` (HTTPS).
It also affords the user of friendly local URLs via http://nip.io/.
