= Setup

The development environment is a first-class component of this system.
From installation and configuration to supporting fast development feedback loops, it should strive to deliver the best developer experience to as many developers as possible.
This section describes the recommended steps to configure a development environment suitable for working on Acme.
Please install tools as they are mentioned in the documentation.

NOTE: Decisions made in service of this goal are often loaded with tradeoffs and are documented as a xref:acme-adr::index.adoc[Decision Record].

== Quick Start

NOTE: These instructions are designed to work on macOS and Ubuntu.
They should also work for Windows under WSL but have not been verified.

1. Install {homebrew-href}[Homebrew]

1. Install https://taskfile.dev/installation/[Task]

1. Install the rest of the development tools:

  $ task dev:setup

1. https://developer.1password.com/docs/cli/get-started#sign-in[Setup the 1Password CLI]

1. Install your preferred <<Docker Manager>>

1. Install your preferred <<Kubernetes Manager>>

== Docker Manager

To run containers you'll need to install a Docker engine manager.
The following products are supported by this tooling:

* https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/[Docker Desktop]

=== Rancher Desktop

https://docs.rancherdesktop.io/[Rancher Desktop] is an alternative to Docker Desktop.
Once installed, configure Rancher Desktop with sudo access and `dockerd` as the container runtime:

[#img-rancher-desktop-sudo]
.Administrative Access > Allow sudo access
image::rancher-desktop-sudo.png[]

[#img-rancher-desktop-docker]
.Container Runtime > dockerd (moby)
image::rancher-desktop-docker.png[]

====
As of this writing Rancher Desktop https://github.com/rancher-sandbox/rancher-desktop/issues/1668[has an issue] with binding to privileged ports on Linux.
The workaround is to adjust the default `net.ipv4.ip_unprivileged_port_start` value to `80`.
Run the following command and restart Rancher Desktop afterwards:

[source,shellscript]
----
sudo sysctl net.ipv4.ip_unprivileged_port_start=80
----

This configuration makes it possible to access Kubernetes Ingress resources on `localhost` over privileged ports `80` (HTTP) and `443` (HTTPS).
It also affords the user of friendly local URLs via http://nip.io/.

== Kubernetes Manager

There are many tools that will run a local Kubernetes cluster The following products are supported by this tooling:

=== GUIs

The following products require a user to point-and-click a GUI to manage a Kubernetes cluster.

==== Docker Desktop

Using Docker Desktop is, arguably, the easiest way to run Kubernetes locally given its ubiquity.
It is also widely supported and actively maintained for all major operating systems.
The main trade-off when choosing Docker Desktop is that the version of Kubernetes **cannot** be changed.

==== Rancher Desktop

Rancher Desktop, similar to Docker Desktop, can also be used to run a local Kubernetes cluster.
An advantage Rancher Desktop has over Docker Desktop is that the version of Kubernetes **can** be changed

> When choosing the Kubernetes version, choose a version with the same minor version specified by the `KUBERNETES_VERSION` environment variable in `Taskfile.yaml`

=== CLIs

The following products are command-line interfaces.
Subjectively, they may offer a better user-experience for developers.

==== minikube

{minikube-href}[minikube] is a command-line tool for running Kubernetes clusters locally.
Follow https://minikube.sigs.k8s.io/docs/start/#what-youll-need[these instructions] to install `minikube`.

==== k3d

{k3d-href}[k3d] is another command-line tool for running Kubernetes clusters.
Follow https://k3d.io/v5.4.8/#installation[these instructions] to install `k3d`.

== IDEs

=== IntelliJ IDEA

{intellij-href}[IntelliJ IDEA] is used for, but not limited to, Kotlin development and Asciidoc authoring.

==== Plugins

The following plugins are recommended for the best development experience:

* {kotest-intellij-href}[Kotest plugin]
* {asciidoc-intellij-href}[AsciiDoc plugin]

==== Configuration

Ensure that IntelliJ is aware of the location of the JDK by opening the `File > Project Structure` menu.

Additionally, ensure that IntelliJ is configured to build and run tests with Gradle.
Under the `Preferences` menu, navigate to `Build, Execution, Deployment > Build Tools > Gradle`:

image::intellij-gradle.png[]

=== Visual Studio Code

{vscode-href}[Visual Studio Code] is primarily used for, but not limited to, TypeScript project development.

==== Plugins

The following plugins are recommended for the best development experience:

* {angular-vscode-href}[Angular Language Service plugin]
* {eslint-vscode-href}[ESLint plugin]

==== Configuration

Visual Studio Code does not require further configuration for this project.

=== Linux Users
