= Tips & Tricks

== IntelliJ

With the {kotest-intellij-href}[Kotest IntelliJ plugin] installed, individual test classes or functions can be run.
This is afforded via the green arrow in the left gutter of a test file:

== Visual Studio Code

Access the run configurations from the `Run and Debug` menu:

In this example a developer can choose to run all tests or just the current file.
Select the desired configuration and click the green arrow button to run.

Optionally, attach the debugger once the test(s) are running by selecting the `Attach to debugger` configuration.
Click the green arrow button to attach.
Visual Studio Code should then display breakpoints like so:
